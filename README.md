spring 2021 green iguana data and analysis. 

Testing, this is a line from Rstudio

This is the Readme file for Spring 2021 green iguana project. This was a large study conducted from March through June at ASU with Dale DeNardo, Elizabeth Wu, and Susannah French. It is part of their NSF funded green iguana microbiome project.

For what is relevant to me, we tested the effects of a high sugar diet on immune function by having different groups (glucose and no glucose) and 2 LPS challeges spaced 4 weeks apart. A biopsy followed this and a GTT. We are also looking at telomere length before and after the study. 

There are two data files GreenIguanaMasterSpring2021, one is CSV and one is an excel workbook. I will never change the excel workbook. I also have Expt-LPS biopsy GTT spring 2021 study timeline revised workbook. This is the timeline for what treatment was given when throughout the whole study. 

There is a R markdown file here, not sure what will go in it yet but I will be using scripts for the analysis most likely. The code folder is where all my scripts for different questions will go into. I'm trying to comparmentalize as much as I can. The output folder is for any figures graphs, etc. from the code

There is a green iguana html file, probably won't use it, don't know how yet.

Authors: Claudia (lead), Dale (implemented the whole study) and Susannah (PIs), Elizabeth Wu (executed entirety of workshop), Erin Lewis (helped me on all of the assays)
